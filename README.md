## D3 Package Overview

[d3-array](https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/master/README.md)
 - Extends JS native arrays with statistical, search, transforming, and plotting methods

[d3-axis](https://github.com/d3/d3-axis/blob/master/README.md)
 - Draws human-readible axes based on a `d3-scale`

[d3-brush](https://github.com/d3/d3-brush/blob/master/README.md)
 - Interactive method to select/adjust data visualization, e.g. zoom region, timeline scrubber

[d3-chord](https://github.com/d3/d3-chord/blob/master/README.md)
 - Graph to visualize matrix of flows across a circular chart

[d3-collection](https://github.com/d3/d3-collection/blob/master/README.md)
 - Set of array-based data structures including map, set, and nest (tree array)

[d3-color](https://github.com/d3/d3-color/blob/master/README.md)
 - Methods to define/adjust colors, e.g. RGB, named colors, opacity, etc.

[d3-dispatch](https://github.com/d3/d3-dispatch/blob/master/README.md)
 - Provides callback registration and listening to separate concerns in code
 - Good example: https://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/5872848

[d3-drag](https://github.com/d3/d3-drag/blob/master/README.md)
 - Provides a flexible abstraction to enable drag-and-drop behavior on graphs

[d3-dsv](https://github.com/d3/d3-dsv/blob/master/README.md)
 - Parsing and formatting of data into delimiter-separate values, e.g. comma or tab
 - Great documentation!
 - d3.csv/d3.tsv are actually part of `d3-request`!

[d3-ease](https://github.com/d3/d3-ease/blob/master/README.md)
 - Animation effects for transitions to provide appealing time distortions, e.g. slow starts
 - Page contains great visualization of different easings!

[d3-forces](https://github.com/d3/d3-force/blob/master/README.md)
 - Physics simulator for forces on particles for interacting objects, e.g. tic-tac toe
 - Also can be useful for network graphs, beeswarm plots, or other common graphs

[d3-format](https://github.com/d3/d3-format/blob/master/README.md)
 - Used for complex number-to-string formatting ala Python 3's .format

[d3-geo](https://github.com/d3/d3-geo/blob/master/README.md)
 - Functions to draw, project, and do various math related to geographic maps
 - This is VERY complex and basic maps should use a small fraction of methods!
